# Indian Premier League Predictions - 2018
The Indian Premier League, officially Vivo Indian Premier League (_for sponsorship reasons_), is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India contested during April and May of every year by teams representing Indian cities and some states.

This project is an attempt to predict the winner of T20 cricket matches. The objective is to predict the result (winner) of every IPL match. The project also predicts the ultimate winner of the tournament. It does not impose a specific development philosophy or framework, so you're free to clone, modify and architect your code in the way that you want and add your contribution to this repository.

## Dataset 
The dataset that we use in this project is IPL (Indian Premier League) Dataset posted on Kaggle Datasets sourced from cricsheet. And calculated Team data based on player EF scores. 

#### EFscore: 
The eigenfactor score, a metric used for ranking teams in different formats of the game. This is an alternative way of ranking teams in international Cricket, by taking into account the relative strengths of the teams. A victory against a relatively stronger team will lead to a higher EFscore as compared to a victory against a relatively weaker team.

The advantage of this method is that it is a non-parametric way of ranking teams, that is we do not give any additional parameters to the algorithm for computing the team rankings.
